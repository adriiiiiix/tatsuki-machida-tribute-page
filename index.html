<b><q>[...] To create not a figure skating boom, but a figure skating culture.</q></b>

  <p><b style="color: #FBA12D">Tatsuki Machida</b> always saw figure skating as a performing art. A quadruple jump could be a piece of art in itself. It was important for him to use his technical capacity to imagine and create. In order to give a good performance, he wanted to understand the culture, to study the music and even the composer’s life. He saw figure skating as belonging in the same category as ballet or dance.</p>

  <p>His skating style has always been described as “larger than life”, “dramatic”, “grand”, and even “regal”. it wasn’t even a “style”; his own personality could be described like that. He was the one who would pay attention to his “airport fashion”, as well as buying new books to read on the road to his competitions. It used to be a pleasure for reporters and fans to follow him around and relish in his quotes.</p>

  <div class="quote info-quote"><q>As soon as Tatsuki Machida, the 2014 world silver medalist from Japan, entered into the Meriadeck rink, TV crews from Japan started following him wherever he would go, from his warm-up to concentration time to –of course– his practice sessions. You can always feel when a master is entering into a hall, former great Pierre Brunet (who coached Carol Heiss to her Olympic victory) used to say. Machida’s taking part in the Trophée should be an event in itself in Bordeaux.</q></div>

  <p>He was never afraid to be himself, never afraid to express his opinions and own up to them. And it showed in his skating; watching him, you feel like you need to stop everything you’re doing and give him your undivided attention. He captivates you and takes you along on his journey. In his self-choreographed works, he has made a lot of experiments. He experimented with the length of the program, he experimented with art direction, and he experimented with playing characters and sharing pages of his personal life. He placed figure skating where he thought it belonged; at the intersection between art and sport.</p>
  
<div class="quote info-quote"><q>You know, in English, we say figure skating, but in French, they say artistic skating. I think they are right. Figure skating should be a performing art, just like ballet or dance. It belongs to the same category. I cherish performing arts.</q></div>
